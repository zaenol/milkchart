# MOVED TO GITHUB #
This project has been moved to GitHub so it could be hosted on the [MooTools Forge](http://mootools.net/forge/).  Please use the version found at the [Forge](http://mootools.net/forge/p/milkchart).

A simple to use, yet robust library for transforming table data into a chart.  This library uses the HTML5 `<canvas>` tag and is only supported on browsers other than IE until [ExCanvas](http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/) gets proper text support.

All of the graphs use shared options from the [Base](Base.md) class.

  * [Column](Column.md)
  * [Bar](Bar.md)
  * [Line](Line.md)
  * [Scatter](Scatter.md)
